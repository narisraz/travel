# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The profiles module currently has domain entities, repositories, and application use cases implemented, but lacks the infrastructure layer needed to persist hotel profiles to the database. This feature will implement the infrastructure layer for the profiles module, including SQLite persistence for hotel profiles, following the same patterns established in the auth module.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to persist hotel profiles to a SQLite database, so that hotel data can be stored and retrieved reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a hotel profile is saved THEN the system SHALL store the hotel data in a SQLite database table
2. WHEN a hotel profile is retrieved by ID THEN the system SHALL return the correct hotel data from the database
3. IF a hotel profile does not exist THEN the system SHALL return null
4. WHEN the database is initialized THEN the system SHALL create the necessary hotel table structure
5. WHEN storing address data THEN the system SHALL handle optional address fields correctly

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the profiles infrastructure to follow the same patterns as the auth module, so that the codebase remains consistent and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the hotel repository THEN the system SHALL use the same SQLite patterns as the auth module
2. WHEN creating database layers THEN the system SHALL follow the Effect Layer pattern used in auth
3. WHEN handling database operations THEN the system SHALL use Effect for error handling and composition
4. WHEN structuring files THEN the system SHALL follow the same directory structure as auth infrastructure

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper database schema management for hotel profiles, so that data integrity is maintained.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the database is initialized THEN the system SHALL create a hotels table with appropriate columns
2. WHEN storing hotel data THEN the system SHALL enforce data constraints and relationships
3. WHEN handling address data THEN the system SHALL store address fields as separate columns or JSON
4. WHEN creating indexes THEN the system SHALL optimize for common query patterns
5. WHEN managing foreign keys THEN the system SHALL properly reference the auth system
